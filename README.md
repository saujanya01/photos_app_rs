# PHOTO APP IN RUST

Some random rust code that will help me organise my photos and videos on my ssd.

## Dec 27th Update

1. can find duplicate videos and photos based on hash.
2. can move the images to new destination based on year/month/date

## TODO

1. Make a small sqlite db to store the hashes in the backup disk. - Use rusqlite
2. backup logic for new sd cards and new photos in old sd cards. - check claude chat (https://claude.ai/chat/9b1881e0-f76b-40fb-a130-79eb6ef866c7)
3. figure out something for easy storage of raw and exported images - not figured out
4. multi ssd syncs - plan this out
5. cloud backup - plan this out
